# ML

Machine learning, and in general, artificial intelligence involves formulating algorithms that a computer can execute in reasonable time to solve tasks, mainly prediction or description oriented tasks.

Popular applications of ML are in robotics, computer vision, NLP, and much more. However, machine learning also encompasses algorithms such as least squares, GLMs, kernel based non-parametric methods, fitting stochastic processes, and methods based on some defined metric space such as SVD or KNN. 

This introduces the idea of modern and classical ML. Many statistical and mathematical theories have been used to provide rigorous lower and upper bounds on error for the classical methods. However, for modern methods, the theory is not as well-known, nor is it entirely well developed. 

Much of the classical methods are well studied, and with enough measure theory and functional analysis (see math section), the proofs are all accesible. so we focus machine learning on the modern methods.
