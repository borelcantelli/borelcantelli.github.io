# Assorted ML Topics

Machine Learning has become a very diverse field with research going in various directions. Some areas of machine learning are experimental in nature, where models and paradigms are proposed and evaluated on many data sets. Other areas are very theoretical, and are aimed at proving guarantees for neural networks of certain architectures. In between these two ends, there are plenty of works that are also interesting. In this section, various topics in machine learning are presented in no particular order.
