# Measure Theory

Measure theory is the study of the **measure**. It is an important basis of probability theory, and in general, integration theory. It is also a natural extension from mathematical analysis which typically finishes with basic integration theory. As measure theory is an important basis for probability theory, the following pages will be dedicated to understanding properties of the measure, as well as motivations for why we study measures.
